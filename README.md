# **Ruby SDK for Contentstack**

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach. It is a CMS that developers can use to build powerful cross-platform applications in their favorite languages. Build your application frontend, and Contentstack will take care of the rest. [Read More](https://www.contentstack.com/). 

Contentstack provides Ruby SDK to build application on top of Ruby on Rails. Given below is the detailed guide and helpful resources to get started with our Ruby SDK.

## **Prerequisite**

You need ruby v2.0 or later installed to use the Contentstack Ruby SDK.

## **Setup and Installation**

Add the following code to your application's Gemfile and bundle:

    gem 'contentstack'

Or you can run this command in your terminal (you might need administrator privileges to perform this installation):

    gem install contentstack

To start using the SDK in your application, you will need to initialize the stack by providing the values for the keys given in the code snippet below.

    # with default region
    client = Contentstack::Client.new("api_key", "delivery_token", "enviroment_name")
    
    # with specific region
    client = Contentstack::Client.new("api_key", "delivery_token", "enviroment_name",{"region": Contentstack::Region::EU})
    
    # with custom host
    client = Contentstack::Client.new("api_key", "delivery_token", "enviroment_name",{"host": "https://custom-cdn.contentstack.com"})

## **Key Concepts for using Contentstack**

### **Stack**

A stack is like a container that holds the content of your app. Learn more about [stacks](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/stack).

### **Content Type**

Content type lets you define the structure or blueprint of a page or a section of your digital property. It is a form-like page that gives Content Managers an interface to input and upload content. [Read more](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/content-types). 

### **Entry**

An entry is the actual piece of content created using one of the defined content types. Learn more about [Entries](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/content-management#working-with-entries). 

### **Asset**

Assets refer to all the media files (images, videos, PDFs, audio files, and so on) uploaded to Contentstack. These files can be used in multiple entries. Read more about [Assets](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/content-management#working-with-assets). 

### **Environment**

A publishing environment corresponds to one or more deployment servers or a content delivery destination where the entries need to be published. Learn how to work with [Environments](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/environments). 

## **Contentstack Ruby SDK: 5-minute Quickstart**

### **Initializing your SDK**

To initialize the SDK, you need to provide values for the keys given in the snippet below:

    stack = Contentstack::Client.new("api_key", "delivery_token", "enviroment_name")

To get the API credentials mentioned above, log in to your Contentstack account and then in your top panel navigation, go to Settings > Stack to view the API Key and Access Token.

### **Querying content from your stack**

To fetch all entries of of a content type, use the query given below:

    entry = stack.content_type(<<CONTENT_TYPE_UID>>).query();

To fetch a specific entry from a content type, use the following query:

    entry = stack.content_type(<<CONTENT_TYPE_UID>>).entry(<<ENTRY_UID>>);

### Get Multiple Entries
To retrieve multiple entries of a content type, specify the content type UID. You can also specify search parameters to filter results:

    @query = @stack.content_type('blog').query
    @entries = @query.where('title', 'welcome')
                    .include_schema
                    .include_count
                    .fetch
    puts "Total Entries -- #{@entries.count}"
    @entries.each{|entry| puts "#{entry.get('title')}" }
To retrieve localized versions of entries, you can use the query attribute:

    entry = @stack.content_type('content_type_uid').query.locale('locale_code').fetch()

> Note: Currently, the above query works in case of retrieving localized versions of multiple entries only.

## **Advanced Queries**

You can query for content types, entries, assets and more using our Ruby API Reference. 

[Ruby API Reference Doc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/contentstack)

### Paginating Responses
In a single instance, the [Get Multiple Entries](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/ruby/get-started-with-ruby-sdk/#get-multiple-entries) query will retrieve only the first 100 items of the specified content type. You can paginate and retrieve the rest of the items in batches using the [skip](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/contentstack/Contentstack/Query#skip-instance_method) and [limit](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/contentstack/Contentstack/Query#limit-instance_method) parameters in subsequent requests.

    @stack = Contentstack::Client.new("api_key", "delivery_token", "environment")
    @entries = @stack.content_type('category').query
                   .limit(20)
                   .skip(50)
                   .fetch

> Note: Currently, the Ruby SDK does not support multiple content types referencing in a single query. For more information on how to query entries and assets, refer the Queries section of our Content Delivery API documentation.

## **Working with Images**

We have introduced Image Delivery APIs that let you retrieve images and then manipulate and optimize them for your digital properties. It lets you perform a host of other actions such as crop, trim, resize, rotate, overlay, and so on. 

For example, if you want to crop an image (with width as 300 and height as 400), you simply need to append query parameters at the end of the image URL, such as, https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blteae40eb499811073/bltc5064f36b5855343/59e0c41ac0eddd140d5a8e3e/download?crop=300,400. There are several more parameters that you can use for your images.
