# Ruby SDK for Built.io andContentstack

Ruby client for [built.io](https://www.built.io)'s [Contentstack](https://www.built.io/products/contentstack/overview)  - the API-first CMS for your app. This SDK interacts only with the [Content Delivery Rest API](https://contentstackdocs.built.io/developer/restapi).

Contentstack is the CMS without the BS. With this headless cms, developers can build powerful cross-platform applications using their favorite front-end javascript frameworks and Android/iOS clients. 

You build your front-end and we will take care of delivering content through APIs, optimized for each destination. - [more here](https://www.built.io/products/contentstack/overview) 

##### [TODOS]

[-] sign up link missing
[-] add logos for react, angular, iOS and Android

## Prerequisite
You only need ruby v2.0 or later installed to use the Built.io Contentstack SDK.

## Setup and Installation
Add this to your application's Gemfile and `bundle`:

```bash
gem 'contentstack'
```

Or you can run this command in your terminal (you might need administrator privileges to perform this installation):

```ruby
gem install contentstack
```

To start using the SDK in your application, you will need to initialize the stack by providing the required keys and values associated with them.

```ruby
client = Contentstack::Client.new(
  api_key: ''
  access_token: 'b4c0n73nExample',
  environment: ''
)
```

##### [TODOS]
[-] Add a DSL for easier more idiomatic configuration


## Key Concepts for using Contentstack

### Stack
A stack is like a container that holds the content of your app. Learn more about creating stacks. [watch videos tutorials with documentation](https://contentstackdocs.built.io/developer/javascript/quickstart)

### Content Type

A content type is the structure of a section with one or more fields within it. It is a form-like page that gives Content Managers an interface to input and upload content. 

### Entry

An entry is the actual piece of content created using one of the defined content types. 

### Asset

Assets refer to all the media files (images, videos, PDFs, audio files, and so on) uploaded to Built.io Contentstack. These files can be used in multiple entries.  

### Environment

A publishing environment corresponds to one or more deployment servers or a content delivery destination where the entries need to be published. 


## 5 minute Quickstart

### Initializing your Stack client
To initialize a Stack client, you need to provide the required keys and values associated with them:

```ruby
stack = Contentstack::Client.new(
  api_key: ''
  access_token: 'b4c0n73nExample',
  environment: ''
)
```

To get the api credentials mentioned above, you need to log into your Contentstack account and then in your top panel navigation, go to Settings -> Stack to view both your `API Key` and your `Access Token`


The `stack` object that is returned a Built.io Contentstack client object, which can be used to initialize different modules and make queries against our [Content Delivery API](https://contentstackdocs.built.io/rest/api/content-delivery-api/). The initialization process for each module is explained below.


### Querying content from your stack

Let us take an example where we try to obtain all entries of the Content Type my_content_type.

```ruby
entry = stack.content_type(<<CONTENT_TYPE_UID>>).query();
```

##### [TODOS]

[-] Where to get your content type and content type uid from
[-] Describe what a preview of the returned `entry` object will look like


Let us take another example where we try to obtain only a specific entry from the Content Type `my_content_type`.

```ruby
entry = stack.content_type(<<CONTENT_TYPE_UID>>).entry(<<ENTRY_UID>>);
```

#### [Todos]
[-] Describe what a preview of the returned `entry` object will look like


## More Usage

You can query for content types, entries, assets and more using our completely documented api. Here are some useful examples:

This is how you get all the `ContentTypes` in your stack:

```ruby
content_types = stack.content_types
```

Get a specific `ContentType` by `content_type_uid`

```ruby
blog_entries = stack.content_type('blog');
```

Get a specific `Entry` by `entry_uid`

```ruby
blog_entry = stack.content_type('blog').entry('blt1234567890abcef')
```

Fetch all entries of requested `content_type`
